           <h3>Past</h3>
           <p>Growing up, I was always interested in science and the arts. I loved competing at the science fair, quiz bowl, and Science Olympiad, but on the opposite end of the spectrum, I loved creative writing, one-act plays, and competitve dance.The best part of it all was watching the work come to life. Stories seemed to jump off of a page and come life on stage just as experiments sprung to life in the lab and lines of code made my computer screen dance with lively designs.</p>

           <h3>Present</h3>
           <p>Currently, I am an undergraduate student at the Georgia Institute of Technology majoring in Computational Media. On campus, I am involved in the Impact Living Learning Community, which is a campus group focused on diversity, sustainability, and social good. In my free time, I like to take classes with DanceTech, write poetry, and participate in the GT WebDev club.

           <h3>Future</h3>
           <p>In the future, I hope to become a UX/UI designer and also get a master's degree in Human Computer Interaction. I would love to one day work as a Product Manager. Later on down the line, I would like to become an entrepreneur.
